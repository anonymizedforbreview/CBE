## Background 

Many engineering study programs around the world have declared its conversion towards a competency-based education model (CBE). However, the implementation of CBE is not a straightforward task, especially regarding the assessment part. Since engineering teachers do not usually have pedagogical training or origin, they often ignore how to correctly perform the assessment under this curricular model.

## Purpose 

The purpose of this work is to provide a systematic assessment model for engineering competency-based courses which can be used as a step-by-step guide.

## Method 

Articles about assessment strategies for competency-based engineering education (CBEE) were analysed concluding that a systematic assessment model was required. Subsequently, a structured assessment model was designed to be used as a step-by-step guide for teachers involved in CBEE programs. The model was applied into three versions of an engineering regular course to verify its effectiveness.

## Results

Three results can be highlighted: i) by using traditional numeric scales, the objectivity in the competency assessment process is guaranteed, ii) the proposed assessment model is generic and therefore, it can be applied to other disciplines, iii) the model was applied in an engineering regular course where results obtained demonstrated its effectiveness.

## Conclusions 

This work provides a framework to assess competency-based engineering courses. The application tests analysed show how to use the assessment model for decision making in order to improve the academic performance of a course. Future research directions include testing the model in other disciplines and designing a framework to evaluate a whole competency-based study program.

## Example of Application

To illustrate how to apply the proposed model a didactical example is reported. The [data](https://github.com/anonymizedforbreview/OSHW/blob/master/references.bib) come from an Automatic Control course of the fifth semester which is part of the new competency-based study program of the master degree on Electrical Engineering at a large university in the central zone of Chile, in South America (it has been anonymized for blind review).
